## Titanic Classification Problem

This is a project dedicated to learning classification on Kaggle as well as attempting to crack the top 200 of all participants. During the course of this project it has been my aim, in the name of learning, to not look at other notebooks that have been developed by others for the sake of struggling and learning on my own. This is definitely considered the hard way but the best way to learn is by doing. This will be a continuous labor of love as I learn more about classification problems as well as other tools and frameworks to incorporate into my analysis and models. I hope you enjoy the progress that I will be making and be sure to check out blog articles that I will be writing to document what I learn. Thank you!
